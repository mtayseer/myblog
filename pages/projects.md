# [rawa7.com](http://rawa7.com)
Egyptian public transit guide (in Arabic), launched in May 2011. I made it using [GeoDjango](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/gis/), [Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/), [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/), [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/), and jQuery. [The mobile app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eg.rawa7&hl=en) is made with [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/).

# [Eidetic](https://github.com/mtayseer/eidetic)
Sometimes I find it hard to remember what I did exactly, so I made this small app to take screenshots of my desktop every few minutes & save them. Made using [PyQt](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro).
