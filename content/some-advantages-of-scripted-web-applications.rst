This is an article by Clinton Forbes explaining why scripting languages
are popular for web applications.

    As far as performance goes, both the ASP and ASP.NET systems hold up
    well in times of high-traffic (usually around the time of major
    sporting events). However the performance of our systems is not due
    to any inherent characteristics of the ASP or ASP.NET environments,
    it is due to careful consideration of which parts of the
    applications are critical for good performance and which pieces of
    content absolutely must be cached to have any hope of coping with
    high-traffic.
