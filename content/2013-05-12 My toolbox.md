Title: My toolbox

It makes me sad when I find out that a lot of people use bad tools, so here is a list of tools that I use almost everyday (as of May 2013). Most of them are great & some of them are acceptable. Feel free to suggest better tools.

### Your life is miserable without these

#### [VLC Player](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)
There are 2 types of people:

People who try to open a movie with [Windows Media Player](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-media-player), but find that they cannot open any movie with it, so they download the [XviD](http://www.xvid.org/) codec & install it. Later, they try to open a movie with extension [RMVB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMVB), then they find that they want another codec which conflicts with the 1st codec, so they remove the 1st codec & install the 2nd, but not all movies requiring XviD works, so they ask a friend who tells them about the [Combined Community Codec Pack](http://www.cccp-project.net/) which plays all kind of videos _except_ Real Media & QuickTime, but if you install [Real Alternative](http://www.filehippo.com/download_real_alternative/) & [QuickTime Lite](http://www.filehippo.com/download_quicktime_alternative/) to play RM & MOV videos. Now they just need to install [DirectVobSub](http://www.codecs.com/download/directvobsub.htm) for subtitles & they are finished. This is just for Windows.

The 2nd type of people installed VLC player & lived happily ever after.

#### [Everything search engine](http://www.voidtools.com/download.php)
So you want to search for files by their name or extension. You open Windows search & type the file name, then you wait, and wait, and wait, and ....

During this, I downloaded & installed [Everything search engine](http://www.voidtools.com/download.php), searched for the files I need, found them & already working on them.

Now, Windows just showed the results. Please remind me why I searched for these files?

#### [SumatraPDF](http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/free-pdf-reader.html)
Why install 48 MB slow application to view PDFs when you can install a 5MB lightning-fast application which can view PDF, MOBI & many different formats?

#### [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [FireFox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
Which one you choose depends on you, but [you should not use IE](https://www.google.com.eg/search?q=don't%20use%20IE).

#### [Paint.net](http://www.getpaint.net/)
Swiss-army knife for raster image editing. What MS Paint is supposed to be.

#### [Virtual CloneDrive](http://www.slysoft.com/en/virtual-clonedrive.html)
Free Virtual CD program without ads. You won't find a better one.

#### [Free Download manager (FDM)](http://www.freedownloadmanager.org/)
Free & easy to use download manager.

#### [youtube-dl](http://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/download.html)
Did you see James Shore series [Let's Play TDD](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0CCC6BD6AFF097B1) & wondered how you are going to download all of these videos to see them offline? youtube-dl can download from youtube & tens of other sites as well.

#### [ffmpeg](http://www.ffmpeg.org/)
FFmpeg is a media conversion tool. I've mixed feelings against it. It's very powerful & fast, but also very hard to use. Each time I've to google how I can use it, but it's performance makes it practical than other conversion tools I tried.

#### [CCleaner](http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner) & [Defraggler](http://www.piriform.com/defraggler)
The best crap cleaner & disk defragmenter.

### For command-line gurus
#### [ConEmu](https://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/)
It's a shell container which groups all your shells in a single window with multiple tabs, including putty.

#### [PyCmd](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pycmd/)
A smarter shell for Windows. I like that when you press TAB it shows all the available options, instead of cycling through all the options. It also supports persistent history.

### For the Ninja programmer
#### [Python](http://python.org)
I used different programming languages, but Python is the swiss-army knife that I use when I've the choice, and it didn't fail me. I used it for small scripts, GUI apps, to high-performance web apps.

#### [Sublime text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
I wanted a powerful text editor (like VI or Emacs) but didn't need me to relearn how to use a text editor. I used [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) for a long time, before I switch to Sublime.

#### [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/) & [Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/)
SQLite is convenient for development, because it doesn't require installation of any kind.

I had nice experience with Postgres when I built [rawa7.com](http://rawa7.com/). Installing PostGIS (Postgres GIS extension) with other GeoDjango dependencies on Windows is painful, but after this it's a joy to use.

It also supports compression, recursive queries, [Multiversion concurrency control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control), custom types, table inheritance, regular expressions & other interesting features. DB choice is probably the hardest thing to change in an enterprise, but Postgres is worth a try.
