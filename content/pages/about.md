![Mohammad Tayseer](/files/mtayseer.jpg)


My name is Mohammad Tayseer, an Egyptian programmer, living in Cairo, Egypt. I'm a Jack-of-All-Trades. These days I work with Python & Javascript, but I worked also with C#, Java & C++, on web & mobile. I believe that a good programmer is responsible for every aspect of software development.

In this blog I write about all aspects of software: from code best practices to the economy of software. All opinions expressed here are mine, and does not represent my employer in anyway.
