Title: SoundCloud playlist downloader
Tags: side-projects, soundcloud, python

[SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com) is a great resource for interesting audio tracks audio tracks. I found 
[this playlist](https://soundcloud.com/tadbrr/sets/fhhepfwqymk1) that I wanted to download. Although the author is allowing download 
of tracks, I've to download each track manually, which is a time-consuming task. I searched for any tool to help me download the whole 
playlist, but I didn't find any. So I did what a [great programmer](http://threevirtues.com/) should do: 
[I made it myself](https://github.com/mtayseer/sc-downloader).

Please don't use it to steal other people's audio tracks.
