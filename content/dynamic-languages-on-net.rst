Today was the 2nd joint `event`_ by `dotnetworks`_ and `EGJUG`_. There
was 2 sessions: Oracle ADF a practical experience (which I didn't
attend, unfortunately), and dynamic languages on .net, by yours truely
:). There were very few people who attended, about 15 people. They were
very active and participating, and I believe they liked the session. The
main goal of the session was introducing `Python`_ (specially
`IronPython`_) to the people, differences and similarities to C# & Java,
and what to apply lessons learnt from Python to these languages. This is
the presentation (which is very simple, because most of the session was
practical)

Also you will find the `DreamPie`_ session (with the sample files used
in the session). DreamPie is an excellent Python shell, which can
integrate with CPython, IronPython and `Jython`_, also giving you
correct AutoComplete. As a bonus, this is also an example of using
`BeautifulSoup`_ - a Python library for parsing badly-formatted HTML -
from C# 4.0. `BeautifulSoupUser.zip`_, `11.csv.zip`_, `11 -
Copy.csv.zip`_, `Python-Session-2011-01-22.html`_
