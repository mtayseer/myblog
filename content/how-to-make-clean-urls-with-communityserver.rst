How to make clean URLs with CommunityServer?

I love clean URLs, for a lot of reasons (that I will not mention here).
I always wanted my blog to have clean URLs, so this is how I did it with
CommunityServer (which is what we use to manage SpellCoder).
In the 'Edit Post' page, go to the 'Options' tab & at the 'Name' field
enter the name of the page (as you want it to appear to your blog
visitor). Spaces will be replaced by underscore '\_'. You can hover over
the question mark '?' to know what are the valid characters.
Unfortunately, you cannot change the URL to an existing page, which is
good & bad at the same time.
I don't know why it doesn't allow hyphens '-' in the URL. You can see it
being used in
`http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/02/26/tip-trick-url-rewriting-with-asp-net.aspx`_,
but maybe because they are using a newer version.
