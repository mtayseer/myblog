A friend told me that there is `an arabic book for Python`_, which is a
translation of "`Byte of Python`_", one of the most popular Python
books.
This is a good step toward popularizing Python, specially among
children.
Please go and download the arabic version. Read it, and tell the author
about any enhancements that the book needs.
