Everyone uses youtube to see his favorite videos. Most of the time, you
need to subscribe to a certain userâ€™s feed using RSS. Unfortunately, the
'Subscribe' buttons subscribes using their own notification system, and
you have to be a member to subscribe.

Contrary to popular beliefs, youtube provides RSS feeds, but they are
hidden. You can subscribe to a user's feed using

And to a certain tag using

[http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/base/videos/-/egypt](http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/base/videos/-/egypt)

The question is: why did they hide this?
