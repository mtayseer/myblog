Finally, the long-awaited Django book is `released`_ under the `GNU Free
Documentation license`_. Everybody can learn and suggest enhancements to
the book or Django.
Does Django runs with IronPython? `Yes`_, it runs on IPCE, but I don't
think that everything runs well, because the different DBMS drivers are
not ported to IronPython yet.
