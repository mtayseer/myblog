Last Friday was the date for `the 1st EgyPy meeting`_. Few people showed
up. We discussed the release of IronPython 2 Alpha 3, IronRuby,
Microsoft support for dynamic languages & DLR.
Also, `Dody`_ showed us `Havana`_, our CMS which we built using C# &
IronPython 1.1. Havana is different because

#. Havana is not strictly a CMS. It's a content management framework
   with a helper interface.
#. It supports uploading of content in zipped files
#. Command-line interface: So you can type "zip \*.jpg" and get all your
   .jpg images compressed in a zip file!!!
#. It supports IronPython scripting: It's not just for designers

We discussed how Havana uses IronPython & the chances of integrating DLR
with it. Writing a workflow DSL in IronRuby will be very nice [:D]
